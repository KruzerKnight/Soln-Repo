#     For any time x, we can have total trips = Î£(x / time[i]) where i in [0, time.size())
# We need to minimize the above mentioned function total trips such that it is greater than or equal to the given variable totalTrips.
# We can use binary search.
# During the contest I got away with keeping lo = 1 and hi = 10 ^ 15
# On further inspection of the problem we can deduce that max value of x can be min(times) * totalTrips . So that can be used as hi
